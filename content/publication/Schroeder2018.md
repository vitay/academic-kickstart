# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "We present a novel architecture for intermediate fusion of Lidar and camera data for neural network-based object detection. Key component is a transformer module which learns a transformation of feature maps from one sensor space to another. This allows large parts of the multi-modal object detection network to be trained unimodally, reducing the required amount of costly multi-modal labeled data. We show effectiveness of the transformer as well as the proposed fusion scheme."
